As long as your repo is public (or you have paid for a GitHub plan), you can assign a DNS entry to the site.
In this case "notes.digitalfishies.com" has been pointed to 185.199.1009.153.

To get this IP address I just pinged "tonynorcross.github.io", the default URL of this blog.
I then added  a custom domain name within the settings > pages in my repository.

![custom domain](/img/custom_domain.png)

The only issue to this is... I think you need to be a developer to make this kind of blog.

For comments, I'll need to hook in Utteranes (<https://utteranc.es/>{:target="_blank"}).
